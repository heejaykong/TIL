질문: Running a java program as an exe in Windows without JRE installed

내가 감을 좀 잡게 된 답변은 Andreas Dolk의 답변:
You can ship the JRE with your application and use that JRE for your application. The effect is the same: The application will be started through an executable (wrapper needed) or script (batch) file and the target machine does not need to have a java runtime installed.

Java doesn't have to be 'installed', it just has to be 'present'.
